# Compiler-Project
<br>
This project is nothing but a translator program that translates <b>HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE</b> i.e. user defined language into <b>C</b> Language. To execute a program written in user defined language, <b>GCC</b> compiler is used. <br>
<br>
In this project, I used <b>FLEX</b> to tokenize the user-defined program and after that these tokens are used in <b>BISON</b> program for the shake of semantic operation. <br>
Finally <b>GCC</b> compiler is used to execute this program.
<br><br>
In this project, the necessary files are: <br><br>
<ul>
  <li>FinalFlexFile.l</li>
  <li>FinalBisonFile.l</li>
  <li>test.txt</li>
  <li>testout.txt</li>
